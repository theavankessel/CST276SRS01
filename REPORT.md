Notes:

This project uses the GoF Observer Pattern.
Changes to temperature, pressure, or humidity, meanTemperature, meandPressure, or meanHumidity will trigger notify and an update. 
For testing purposes, my program generates only new temperatures between 18 and 19 degrees celcius to trigger an update. It does not change the humidity or the pressure.
For the purposes of this assgnment, I have maintained the naming convenction of observer and subject to show that I have followed the pattern and adhered with the UML specification.
